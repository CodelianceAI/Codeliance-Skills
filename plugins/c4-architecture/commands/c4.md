description: Analyse a codebase and generate a C4 architecture model in Structurizr DSL
argument-hint: [update|full]
---

Analyse the current project and generate a C4 architecture model by following the c4-architecture skill instructions. The primary output is `architecture/workspace.dsl`.

**Modes:**

- **`/c4`** or **`/c4 full`** — scan the entire codebase and generate a complete workspace from scratch.
- **`/c4 update`** — read the existing `architecture/workspace.dsl`, diff against the current codebase, and update only what changed.
